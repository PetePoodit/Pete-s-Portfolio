I used to compete in a Kasetsart University's Hackathon with my team to develop a new application for student, We made it to the Top 10 round. We were tasked with designing a new feature to help university students simplify and improve their daily lives.

###  2nd year Java's Project

This project, which I developed with my friend, is a program designed to help university students submit their requests more easily. We used IntelliJ IDEA to build the program in Java, and through this process, I gained valuable knowledge about the various components involved in creating a functional application. It was an incredibly fun and rewarding experience.
