###  2nd year Java's Project

This project, which I developed with my friend, is a program designed to help university students submit their requests more easily. We used IntelliJ IDEA to build the program in Java, and through this process, I gained valuable knowledge about the various components involved in creating a functional application. It was an incredibly fun and rewarding experience.

A Concert Booking website design in Figma, A project I collaborated on with my friend. We identified that most event ticket buying websites looked outdated and were difficult to navigate, so we designed a more modern and user-friendly alternative.

**Key Highlights:**
- Streamlined user journey and booking flow
- Modern, responsive design principles
- Enhanced visual hierarchy and navigation
- Focus on user experience and accessibility

A practice project where I reimagined the McDonald's mobile app interface. Using the original app as inspiration, I created a more engaging and visually appealing prototype that aims to make the food ordering experience more enjoyable. The redesign focuses on bringing fun elements while maintaining the brand's iconic identity.
